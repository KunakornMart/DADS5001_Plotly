#### Explain why choose the chart with your data : 
I chose the Stacked Bar Chart because I want to show the overall cost and the proportion. If I use separate charts, it will be difficult to see the overall cost of each beer product. Or, if you want to see the total price, you have to add up the price of each bar. The most important thing that CEO or everyone wants to see is the total cost, and the other proportions are just components. Therefore, I chose to use the Stacked Bar Chart and added a red marker to show the standard cost value. This value should not be exceeded, otherwise the beer cost will be too high.

#### Additional Explanation: 
This graph shows the production and packaging costs of Singha beer for February 2024. Each bar represents the cost of producing beer, including brewing, fermenting, storage, and cooling, up to the cost of packaging beer, including taxes for each packaging of beer. 

When looking at the overall picture, we can observe that the production cost of Singha 320ml is the highest. Some may wonder why the cost of Singha 620ml isn't highest. This is because the costs shown here are in unit baht per liter. In 1 liter, the 320ml beer utilizes a higher quantity of bottles, labels, and other materials compared to the 620ml beer. 

Additionally, many may question why exported beer has a lower cost than domestic beer. This is due to tax considerations. When examining the sub-proportions of the 320ml and 620ml beers sold domestically, a significant excise tax portion can be observed (seen in the detail labels on the right labeled 'Excise Singha 620 & Excise Singha B320'), which is higher than the production and packaging costs by a factor of 3 to 4. 

However, for exported beer, distributors in other countries have to pay import taxes themselves. As for beer sold domestically, taxes have to be paid at the factory through coding and stamping in the factory, with excise officers stationed at the factory to ensure accuracy. 

The long red lines above each bar represent the standard cost of production set by the company,  This is the maximum cost that the company allows for each type of beer. If the actual cost exceeds the standard cost, the company needs to investigate and take corrective action. These items must be summarized weekly and monthly and sent to Managing Director and the CEO. This allows them to track costs and make decisions if the costs change.
